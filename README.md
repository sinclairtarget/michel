Michel is a minimal static site builder based on [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/).

## Model
`content` directory. Files with YAML frontmatter, MyST markdown body.

`site` directory. Templated HTML pages. Every page in the website corresponds
to a templated HTML page. No auto-generation or magic.
